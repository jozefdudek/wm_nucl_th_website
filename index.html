Our group performs theoretical calculations relevant to nuclear and
  hadron physics within the theory of
  quarks and gluons, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We have a
  particular interest in the numerical technique known as <i>lattice
  QCD</i>. We mentor postdoctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate
  students pursuing research in nuclear theory, and we maintain a
  close connection with the nearby Jefferson Lab, where we are members
  of the Theory Center.

       Joe Karpie awarded DoE Fellowship
      </h2>

      <p>
       Joe Karpie is the recipient of an award from the Department of Energy’s Office of
       Science Graduate Student Research Program. Karpie is one of 53 graduate students, representing 45 U.S. universities, who have received the DOE award. Karpie studies theoretical and computational aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at the DOE’s Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in Newport News.
