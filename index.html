Our group performs theoretical calculations relevant to nuclear and
  hadron physics within the theory of
  quarks and gluons, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We have a
  particular interest in the numerical technique known as <i>lattice
  QCD</i>. We mentor postdoctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate
  students pursuing research in nuclear theory, and we maintain a
  close connection with the nearby Jefferson Lab, where we are members
  of the Theory Center.

       Review of scattering and resonance physics using lattice QCD
       published in Reviews of Modern Physics
      </h2>

      <p>
     A pedagogic review of the progress made recently in determining
     the properties of unstable hadron resonances in lattice QCD has
     appeared in <a
