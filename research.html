<b>Dudek's</b> research interests lie principally in understanding the
<b>spectrum of excited hadrons</b> within QCD. While the traditional
picture of hadrons has mesons as $q\bar{q}$ bound-states and baryons
as $qqq$, QCD in principle allows for a much richer spectrum, which
might include states constructed from larger numbers of quarks, or
hadrons featuring only glue (glueballs) or quarks and glue
(hybrids). </br></br>

Complicating matters is the fact that excited hadrons are unstable
states, <i>resonances</i>, which can decay into lighter, stable
hadrons, and the dynamics which binds quarks and gluons into hadrons,
is the same dynamics which controls their decay &mdash; both must be
studied simultaneously.</br></br>

Dudek is interested in application of <b>lattice QCD</b> to problems
in hadron spectroscopy, and recent calculations by Dudek and his
collaborators appear to show, as well as the expected $q\bar{q}$-like mesons
and $qqq$-like baryons, also the presence of hybrid mesons and baryons in the
excited spectra (see e.g.
<a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/916109">mesons</a>,
<a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1084189">baryons</a>) </br></br>

The resonant nature of excited states can be studied through their
appearance in <i>scattering amplitudes</i>, which can be extracted
from lattice QCD calculations by utilizing the dependence of the
lattice spectrum on the size of the 'box' defined by the lattice
boundary. Recent calculations have considered the $\rho$ and $\sigma$
resonances in $\pi\pi$ elastic scattering, and coupled-channel resonances
like the $a_0$ in $\pi\eta, K\bar{K}$ and the $f_0$ and $f_2$'s in
$\pi\pi, K\bar{K}, \eta\eta$.
