<b>Dudek</b>'s research interests lie principally in understanding the
<b>spectrum of excited hadrons</b> within QCD. While the traditional
picture of hadrons has mesons as $q\bar{q}$ bound-states and baryons
as $qqq$, QCD in principle allows for a much richer spectrum, which
might include states constructed from higher numbers of quarks, or
hadrons featuring only glue (glueballs) or quarks and glue
(hybrids). </br>
