<b>Carlson's</b> research interests... </br>

<b>Dudek's</b> research interests lie principally in understanding the
<b>spectrum of excited hadrons</b> within QCD. While the traditional
picture of hadrons has mesons as $q\bar{q}$ bound-states and baryons
as $qqq$, QCD in principle allows for a much richer spectrum, which
might include states constructed from larger numbers of quarks, or
hadrons featuring only glue (glueballs) or quarks and glue
(hybrids). </br></br>

Complicating matters is the fact that excited hadrons are unstable
states, <i>resonances</i>, which can decay into lighter, stable
hadrons, and the dynamics which binds quarks and gluons into hadrons is the same dynamics which controls their decay &mdash; both must be
studied simultaneously.</br></br>

Dudek is interested in application of lattice QCD to problems
in hadron spectroscopy, and recent calculations by Dudek and his
collaborators appear to show, as well as the expected $q\bar{q}$-like mesons
and $qqq$-like baryons, also the presence of hybrid <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/916109">mesons</a> and <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1084189">baryons</a> in the
excited spectra. </br></br>

The resonant nature of excited states can be studied through their
appearance in <i>scattering amplitudes</i>, which can be extracted
from lattice QCD calculations by utilizing the dependence of the
lattice spectrum on the size of the 'box' defined by the lattice
boundary. Recent calculations have considered the
<a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1382163">$\rho$</a> and <a
href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1477214">$\sigma$</a> resonances in
$\pi\pi$ elastic scattering, and coupled-channel resonances like the
<a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1421934">$a_0$</a> in $\pi\eta,
K\bar{K}$ and the <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1618009">$f_0$
and $f_2$'s</a> in $\pi\pi, K\bar{K}, \eta\eta$.

<b>Shanahan's</b> research interests lie in understanding the
emergence of the complexity of <b>hadron and nuclear structure</b>
from the Standard Model of particle physics. Shanahan combines
analytic methods such as effective field theories and supercomputer
calculations on discrete spacetimes (lattice QCD) to solve the complex
equations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and quantum electrodynamics
(QED). Recently, she has been working on novel applications of machine
learning techniques to this problem. </br></br>


Working towards a ground-up understanding of nuclear physics,
Shanahan, Orginos and collaborators have performed the first
first-principles theoretical calculation of the matrix element
dictating the proton-proton fusion cross-section, which is the
reaction that provides the dominant energy production mechanism in
stars like the Sun. They also achieved direct calculations of
double-beta decay matrix elements for the first time, revealing a
previously neglected and potentially significant contribution to these
processes. These calculations, and future refinements to fully control
all systematic uncertainties, will be invaluable to the interpretation
of the results of significant existing and planned experimental
programs searching for evidence of the Majorana nature of neutrinos. </br></br>


Shanahan has recently established a program to determine, for the
first time, quantities which describe the gluonic structure of light
nuclei. This structure provides a window to the intriguing phenomenon
of confinement and the emergence of complex structure in Nature. While
very few aspects of gluonic structure have been determined
experimentally at the present time, an Electron-Ion Collider designed
with the specific aim of performing first measurements of many gluonic
structure quantities is the highest priority for new construction in
the long-range plan of the nuclear physics community. This program is
currently in the planning phase, with data-taking anticipated within
the next decade. Recent results include the first indication that the
gluon structure of light nuclei is not simply that of a
non-interacting collection of nucleons—that is, the first indication
of ‘exotic’ nuclear glue effects. </br></br>
